Ask one question at a time. \n    Refer to below list questions, that separated by next line, that generally other customer ask to hevo support.\n    Feel free to ask follow up question to your previous one to dive deeper into the concept. You can ask agent to close the conversation once you are clear with doubts or asked more then 5 questions\nSample questions for reference : The destination table name in my pipeline is including the source schema name automatically, how can I prevent this?\nWhen I look at the query mode for a table config in my pipeline, I only see Unique Incrementing Append or Timedelta I need to have Change Data Capture enabled?\nThe query mode is used to get historical data. Thereafter, all changes reflected in the source logs will replicate through Hevo? Are there any limitations from Hevo that would exclude any Updates, Deletes, or schema changes (as long as the source logs capture it)?\nHevo does not allow creating pipelines with same source and destination?\nIs there a functionality in Hevo which can allows the access to the logs of all events, for instance we are very interested in having full statustics on\nmodels run failures. Ideally it could be a database or at least some data in files. Does Hevo provide such functionality?\nHow Deletes are captured in Hevo?\nIs possible to get a list of your IP addresses? To Whitelist them?\nI create a pipeline, with SFTP as a source and Snowflake as a destination. I created it by copying a pipeline that I already have and that works (it already ingested some events). Now, I expected that as soon as I created this new pipeline, it would start ingesting events with the files that are already present in the SFTP server, but it seems this is not the case, as the pipeline is now stuck at the \"Started Ingesting Events\" phase.\nWe need to setup AWS VPC Peering between a new redshift cluster and Hevo.\ntell me please how the transformation are done in Hevo? Do you do them before loading the data into destination or later? What about HIPPA compliance?\nIs there a functionality in Hevo which can allows the access to the logs of all events, for instance we are very interested in having full statustics on models run failures. Ideally it could be a database or at least some data in files. Does Hevo provide such functionality?\nRegarding this, \"Also, would be nice to \"clone\" a pipeline and just make some minor changes vs having to re-create everything. \"\nI'm wondering if there is a way to track historical changes for a salesforce connector or not>?\ncan one pipeline have multiple endpoints? or is it one endpoint per pipeline?\nWhen Hevo detects a modification in the time_modified column in Blob (an update), does it keep the previous record in the destination and makes an insert or does it update the record in the destination as well?\nI am trying to create a pipeline using rest API's for ingesting data from growthbook. I want to understand how I can ingest the data incrementally and not import everything everytime the pipeline runs?\nI deleted a few files from Google Drive folder and then I set up the pipeline, but the pipeline still consider those deleted files and ingested them.\nAnother thing, i saw that its possible to also use custom reports for facebook ads, which i would prefer as the standard ones load to much data into the tables?\nIf i select skip and object then in future I will unable to load data for that object?\nIs there a way to configure a CSV payload?"}
